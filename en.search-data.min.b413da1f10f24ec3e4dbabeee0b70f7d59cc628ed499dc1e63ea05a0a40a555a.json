You can just refer to the ShaderGraph sample.\nFor Shader Code# It\u0026rsquo;s also convenient to extend your hand written shaders to receive LTC lighting, there already exists helper functions to convert URP\u0026rsquo;s lit shader input to LTC lighting input, actually they are quite the same.\nUse URP lit as an example, firstly we should include LTC shaders in LitForwardPass.hlsl:\n#include \u0026#34;Packages/com.petabytes.ltclight/Shaders/LTC_URP.hlsl\u0026#34;Then add LTC lighting after URP\u0026rsquo;s pbr calculation:\n// For example in LitForwardPass.hlsl InitializeBakedGIData(input, inputData); half4 color = UniversalFragmentPBR(inputData, surfaceData); // Add LTC lighting here color.rgb += CalculateFragmentLTC(inputData, surfaceData);That\u0026rsquo;s all!\nThe last step is adding LTC light instances in your scene.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/ltclight/light_types/","title":"LTC Light Types","section":"LTC Real Time Area Lights","content":"LTC Lights# Currently we support polygon light, linear light and textured area light.
